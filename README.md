# README

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @yousifj129! Welcome to my GitHub profile.

## About Me
I'm interested in .NET, Python, and C++, and I'm currently learning machine learning. I have a strong background in mathematics, particularly in calculus, as I have studied calculus 1 and calculus 2, as well as multivariable calculus and tensor calculus.

## Collaboration
I'm open to collaborating on any projects. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any ideas or if you need assistance with your projects.

Looking forward to connecting with you!
